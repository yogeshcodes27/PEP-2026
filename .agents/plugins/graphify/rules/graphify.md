# Graphify Rules

This project uses Graphify for persistent AST knowledge graph indexing.

## Rules
- For codebase or architecture questions, when `graphify-out/graph.json` exists, first run `graphify query "<question>"` (CLI) or `query_graph` (MCP).
- Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` / `shortest_path` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` / `get_node` for focused concepts.
- If `graphify-out/wiki/index.md` exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files.
- Read `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
